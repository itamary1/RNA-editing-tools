                                    RNA Editing Standard Pipeline    

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An pipeline designed to run RNA editing analysis.

the pipeline input is sra accessions list or folder with fastq files

every .nf file have compatible .config file in the Configs folder

run the nf file with:

nextflow -c file.config run file.nf 

set your deserved genome by 
-profile like

for running the whole pipeline run:

nextflow -c ${PIPELINE_DIR}/Configs/Docker/full_levanon_pipeline.nf.docker.config run ${PIPELINE_DIR}/full_levanon_pipeline.nf -profile hg38 --use_existing_fastq false --ACC_list small_srr.RL75.Human.txt --genome_length 75 --project_dir $PWD &> run.out.txt &


the pipeline consists of two major pipelines:
-  downloadAndPreprocess.nf
    will run quality checks and will clean the retrieved fastq files
-  analizeEditing_on_cleanData.nf
    will map fastq files using star, and calculate gene expression and RNA editing in several ways
you can run any of the two pipeline by itself or run the small subpipelines in the Subpipline folder

every nf file contain example of running command if you run its with --help


installation:

    install Nextflow and all its dependency https://nextflow.io/ 

    run init.sh file - it will download all the heavy resources from the web and will create salmon and star indexes
    !!!!  run init.sh wil take many hours !!!!


    If you not run on levanon labs servers:


        take care of code that not run inside dockers:
            You can disable the summarizing scripts with the params
            run_cmp_summarize = false
            run_salmon_summary = false
            run_star_summarize_script = false
